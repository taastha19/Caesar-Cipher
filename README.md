# Caesar-Cipher

-> Developed a Caesar Cipher encryption program in Python to encode and decode messages using a simple substitution cipher technique.
-> Allowed users to input a message and choose a fixed number of positions (key) for shifting characters in the alphabet.
-> Supported both encoding and decoding functionalities, enabling users to securely transmit and receive messages.
-> Utilized Python's built-in string manipulation functions to process user input and perform character shifting operations efficiently.
